I am a graduate student at Purdue University working with Professor Milisavljevic and the Time Domain Astronomy Group. I specializes in supernova remnants, especially using proper motion measurements to determine the age and explosion center of the remnant. In addition, I create 3D reconstructions of supernova remnants for morphological comparisons. 

I also study diffuse interstellar bands. I use multi epoch observations to gain insights into the origins of the diffuse interstellar band carriers.
