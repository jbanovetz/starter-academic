**Supernova Remnants: Center of Expansion and Age**

One of my research interests is determining the center of expansion and age of supernova remnants. These two properties are very important for remnant modeling, 3D supernova simulations, and companion star searches. One of the most robust methods to do this is measuring proper motions of supernova ejecta and use their trajectory and velocity to calculate the center of expansion and age.

Using this method, I helped determine the center of expansion and age for supernova remnant 1E 0102.2-7219. By measuring the proper motions of 120 knots of gas, our group was able to calculate a new center of expansion and age estimate for the remnant.

I plan of continuing this research for other supernova remnants. I also plan on creating an automated procedure for measuring the proper motions of the knots of gas. 

**3D Supernova Remnant Reconstructions**

3D reconstructions of supernova remnants provide unique insights into the parent explosion and the subsequent remnant formation. This is especially important, as one of the major questions in astronomy is how much of the remnant morphology is created by the supernova explosion versus the surrounding environment.

My research interest lies in creating 3D reconstructions by utilizing integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. IFU spectroscopy uniquely allows observers to map the various elements of the supernova remnant in plane-of-sky space and Doppler velocities. This allows for a 3D reconstruction of the remnant in many elements, which creates a full picture of the remnant. Observers can then compare remnants to determine similarities or differences in structure and gain insights into the parent supernova explosion

**Diffuse Interstellar Bands**

Diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are an enigma in astronomy over a century old. They represent over 500 absorption features with no known carriers. Originally thought to originate in interstellar medium, there have been recent reports that have shown that some DIBs vary with time, indicating a source much closer to stellar objects.

My interest lies in trying to find more examples of time varying DIBs by obtaining spectra of stars at multiple epochs. This study will include studying more DIBs for time-variability as well as increasing the number of stars, to determine the type, if any, that produce this feature. By studying time-varying DIBs, we can gain insights into the production of DIBs carriers, the location of the carriers, and possible DIB-DIB correlations.
