One of my research interests is determining the center of expansion and age of supernova remnants. These two properties are very important for remnant modeling, 3D supernova simulations, and companion star searches. One of the most robust methods to do this is measuring proper motions of supernova ejecta and use their trajectory and velocity to calculate the center of expansion and age.

Using this method, I helped determine the center of expansion and age for supernova remnant 1E 0102.2-7219. By measuring the proper motions of 120 knots of gas, our group was able to calculate a new center of expansion and age estimate for the remnant.

I plan of continuing this research for other supernova remnants. I also plan on creating an automated procedure for measuring the proper motions of the knots of gas.
