Diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are an enigma that has plagued astronomy for over a century. They represent over 500 absorption features with no known carriers. Originally thought to originate in interstellar medium, there have been recent reports that have shown that some DIBs vary with time, indicating a source much closer to stellar objects.

My interest lies in trying to find more examples of time varying DIBs by obtaining spectra of stars at multiple epochs. This study will include studying more DIBs for time-variability as well as increasing the number of stars, to determine the type, if any, that produce this feature. By studying time-varying DIBs, we can gain insights into the production of DIBs carriers, the location of the carriers, and possible DIB-DIB correlations.
