3D reconstructions of supernova remnants provide unique insights into the parent explosion and the subsequent remnant formation. This is especially important, as one of the major questions in astronomy is how much of the remnant morphology is created by the supernova explosion versus the surrounding environment.

My research interest lies in creating 3D reconstructions by utilizing integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. IFU spectroscopy uniquely allows observers to map the various elements of the supernova remnant in plane-of-sky space and Doppler velocities. This allows for a 3D reconstruction of the remnant in many elements, which creates a full picture of the remnant. Observers can then compare remnants to determine similarities or differences in structure and gain insights into the parent supernova explosion.
