abstract: We present new proper-motion measurements of optically emitting
  oxygen-rich knots of supernova remnant 1E 0102.2-7219 (E0102), which are used
  to estimate the remnant's center of expansion and age. Four epochs of
  high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope images spanning 19 yr were retrieved
  and analyzed. We found a robust center of expansion of α = 1h04m02.48 s and δ
  = -72°01'53"92 (J2000) with 1σ uncertainty of 1"77 using 45 knots from images
  obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys using the F475W filter in 2003
  and 2013 having the highest signal-to-noise ratio. We also estimate an upper
  limit explosion age of 1738 ± 175 yr by selecting the knots with the highest
  proper motions and these knots are assumed to be the least decelerated. We
  find evidence of an asymmetry in the proper motions of the knots as a function
  of position angle. We conclude that these asymmetries were most likely caused
  by interaction between E0102's original supernova blast wave and an
  inhomogeneous surrounding environment, as opposed to intrinsic explosion
  asymmetry. The observed nonhomologous expansion suggests that the use of a
  free expansion model inaccurately offsets the center of expansion and leads to
  an overestimated explosion age. We discuss our findings as they compare to
  previous age and center of expansion estimates of E0102, as well as their
  relevance to a recently identified candidate central compact object.
